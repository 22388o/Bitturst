First Bitcoin Lightning Network .The Second Layer Routing Network 
The goal is to write a minimal web extension to allow browsers to interact with the Lightning Network programmatically. It focuses on the web-payments process and does not try to be a full node UI with advanced channel-management or similar features.

The extension implements the WebLN standard as the interface that allows websites to connect to Lightning Network nodes (to request payments, invoices, signatures, login, etc.) and enable seamless UX of web payments and authentications.

The extension can connect to different node implementations and supports custodial and non-custodial setups.

 Custom budgets/allowances for websites to allow payment streams/auto-payments
 Multiple accounts and support for different node backends (lnd, etc.)
 Full WebLN send and receive payment flows (getInfo, sendPayment, fixed makeInvoice support)

 Payment history with additional website metadata
